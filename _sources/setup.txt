**********************************
This package is dependent on scipy, numpy, PyQt4, lmfit and pyexcel. It has only been tested on python 3.4.

An anaconda3 base installation is recommended and available here: https://www.continuum.io/downloads

Following a successful Anaconda installation, the following commands should be executed in the console:

Curve fitting toolbox used in placed of scipy.optimize:

- pip install lmfit

Package to allow easy import of xls files (which is more convenient than using csv)

- pip install pyexcel_xls

Package to allow serialization of functions which are not explicitely declared

- pip install dill


The following should be executed in the root fDAPI directory (which contains setup.py)

- setup.py install

To verify the installation was successful, run the testProjectDB.py file, you should get an output indicating 96 titer objects are parsed and a GUI should load.
